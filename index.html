                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>My first project with a python application made using tnkinter for the GUI. The project was to create
                    a way for students to plan there college courses further in advance at my old community college
                    DMACC. This allowed student to plan there schedules upto 6 semesters in advance with the ability to
                    see all of the over 2000+ courses offered at the college.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>My second project was also a python application made using tnkinter for the GUI. The project was
                    movie and TV show watchlist app which used data files provided by imdb and a little a bit web
                    scraping which was used to display over 500 thousand different movies and TV series to the user. The users were allowed
                    to add things to a watchlist and could sort there watchlists on a few different parameters</p>
